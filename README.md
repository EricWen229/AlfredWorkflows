some workflows I wrote for Alfred

## Netease Music Controls

Control Netease Music to:

* play/pause current song
* play previous/next song
* like/dislike current song

Examples:

* **nm**toggle: play/pause current song
* **nm**prev: play previous song
* **nm**next: play next song
* **nm**like: like/dislike current song

(this workflow includes remote page)

##### New: Native style of Netease Music control
Now you can control Netease Music and iTunes with the same set of commands:
- `play` or `pause` for Play / Pause track
- `next` for Next track
- `previous` for Previous track
- `like` for Like track (Netease Music only)
